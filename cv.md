## Summary:
In 2016, working as deputy chief engineer of a construction company, I and another employee decided to make a website for our organization, for these purposes I used the hacked version of a program for writing websites that subsequently ruined us all the pictures. I decided to deal with this and found out that there is such an HTML language on which all sites are written, as well as javascript because of which, as I thought, the pictures went bad. And the more I immersed myself in studying, the more I liked it. And I was attracted by the moment that I immediately saw the result of my work, and not after 2-3 years, as it happened in construction. Since then, I decided that I would become a developer.
